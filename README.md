# Wonton

Wonton will be a fantasy computer with interaction combinators as its base operations.

Filling is a simple virtual machine that performs interaction combinator reduction. 
This is the core that Bowl is based on.

Bowl, Wonton's main programming language, will be a GC-less functional language.

## Random thoughts

A higher order lambda that clones its variables cannot be cloned. You win some, you lose some...

Goal: bootstrapping I guess?
